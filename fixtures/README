This directory needs a binary copy of git and a .fixtures/tmp/
directory for the application to properly function.  

In particular, git = Ubunto 10.04 LTS version compatible.

And there is no compatible system tmp directory in cloud foundry, so
the tmp directory needs to be stored locally.

Do not move or rename these files.
